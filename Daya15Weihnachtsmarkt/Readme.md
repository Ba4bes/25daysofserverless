# 25daysofserverless Day 15

## Process

**Update**: I have cleaned up this code. [Click here for the original submission](https://github.com/Ba4bes/25daysofserverless/tree/0ced06700f7f085da9201888182f31ad7a05811d/Daya15Weihnachtsmarkt)

So I started off with day 7 and worked from there.
I changed the second function to get the tags and description through Azure Cognitive services.

## Call the function

The function is meant to be visited in a browser: <https://4besday15.azurewebsites.net/FrontPage>

## The Challenge

### WeihNachtsMarkt

*Sunday, 15 December*  
Here in Munich, Germany, Felix is excited to go to a traditional Weihnachtsmarkt, a holiday market! He keeps texting photos to his friend Anna about all the fun things he's doing: drinking hot mulled Gl√ºhwein, going ice skating, shopping for presents. But Anna can't find her glasses, and can't clearly see what's in the pictures!

For today's challenge, Anna needs a service that, given an image, describe the image and gives some keywords about what it contains.
